# Project Briefing

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build classification models that can predict whether a costumer will default on its credit card payment in the following month

## Dataset

The data used refers to costumer's behavior in regards to its credit card payments. It also show whether a costumer has defaulted on its following payment or not. 

The dataset to be used can be found on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#
